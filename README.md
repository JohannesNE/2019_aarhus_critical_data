Details: With an effort to engage interdisciplinary teams and accelerate research in precision health, we will introduce two datasets at this event i) the clinical data from the Michigan Genomics Initiative Cohort and ii) the Philips eICU dataset. 

These datasets will be hosted through Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Working in interdisciplinary teams, researchers will explore the data in GCP which has been tailored to working with health data. Once familiar with the dataset, teams will formulate technically interesting AND clinically relevant problems that can be solved using the data. 

Teams are invited to then pitch their ideas to a panel of experts. To encourage teams to continue working together to answer their research questions, winning teams will receive up to $1,000 in Google Cloud Platform credits (sponsored by Google).
